# data-strip
Tool for stripping conductivity and pH vales from CSV files generated by an industrial monitor

The monitor records half-hourly values in this format:

01.10.2020 00:00:03;   2.2; ; ;  6.99; ; ; Inactive; Off; Off; Off; Off; 

Spacing is consistent. Conductivity comes after date/time, then pH.  One CSV per day.

This takes conductivity or pH (one script each), averages the hourly values from each CSV, then adds to a new CSV with collated data.
For pH, both an arithmetic mean and a mean converted via [H+] are calculated.

Iterates directory containing source CSVs.  Writes to defined new CSV.
