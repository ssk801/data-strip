# data-strip
Tool for stripping conductivity and pH vales from CSV files generated by an industrial monitor

The monitor records half-hourly values in this format:

01.10.2020 00:00:03;   2.2; ; ;  6.99; ; ; Inactive; Off; Off; Off; Off; 

Spacing is consistent. Conductivity comes after date/time, then pH.  One CSV per day.

Script iterates directory containing source CSVs. Then takes conductivity or pH (one script for each), averages the half-hourly values from each CSV, then adds to a new CSV with collated data. For pH, both an arithmetic mean and a mean converted via [H+] are calculated.  Finally writes the daily averages to a new CSV.

To-do:
Blank lines in the source CSVs cause a crash which can be fixed by manual deletion.  Could fix this?
Could combine pH and conductivity into one script
